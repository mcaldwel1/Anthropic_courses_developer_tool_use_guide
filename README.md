# Anthropic Developer guide for the tool use section
This guide is an all-in-one solution key to Anthropic's tool_use mastery courses.
Before taking a look at the repository, follow along each tutorial located at https://github.com/anthropics/courses/tree/master/tool_use. \
For you to run the scripts, you'll have to enter your own anthropic API keys. \
You're more than welcome to alter the postgres database tables provided in TechNova.py. \
However, I reccomend creating your own database connections for a more comprehensive educational experience.
